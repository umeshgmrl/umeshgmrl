### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


Hi! I'm an experienced front-end developer with six years of crafting interactive web experiences. My journey has taken me from startups to global corporations, navigating through various projects, from single-page applications to large-scale e-commerce platforms.

I view development as an artâ€”my canvas is the browser, my paints are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and my masterpiece is the seamless user interface that enhances user experiences. I have a solid grasp of the latest front-end libraries, frameworks, and tools and have a knack for turning design mockups into responsive, user-friendly websites.

My toolset includes, but is not limited to React, TypeScript, ES6, Git, npm, Gulp, Grunt, and Webpack. Besides coding, I value empathy, client vision, problem-solving, and aesthetic sensibility.
